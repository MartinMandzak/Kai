# My very first attempt at a machine learning model

So... This is the cleaned up version of the neural network I made.
I apologise ahead of time for all the mess in regards to the over all structure and complete lack of best practice.
Person who wrote this was a broken man by the end of it. I'd bet a lot of money that you could see my mental decline just by looking through the commits.

## Why have I chosen a neural network over something like a linear regression tree?
Before I conceived the idea of calculating customer lifetime value or churn rate in general, I have already decided on wanting to make a neural network for my thesis.
I was essentially working backwards to justify having it in, essentially choosing a job for the tool rather than the other way around.
I would never do this in a production environment, however, this thesis was a passion project of mine and I was glad to have the option of making it work like this.

I will try to comment the code the best I can to shed some light on why I made the design choices I have.
Well, ... good luck!
